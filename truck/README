Qilex - A simulator of robots.

Information

Qilex is a simulator of robot, specially robotics arms. It can simulate any (more than 6 dof) kinematic chain.
You need some parameters (D-H) and some inventor file of the robot. It can also incorporate static elements to the scene.
It's multiplatform application in the way that the libraries and the tools that use Qilex were.


Features so far:

It incorporates a little interpret to manipulate the robot.
Can calculate the direct kinematics of any robot.
Can calculate the inverse kinematic of a lot of robots.
The graphics are powerfull. Thank's Open Inventor.

Requirements:

Qilex requires the development files of the following libraries to be present on your system in order to compile:
Flex++ - Flex is a fast lexical analyser generator.

Bison++ - A powerful tool to generate parsers. NOT BISON

Open Inventor - An Open Inventor library. I recommend Coin.

Qt (>= 3.X) - A multiplatform C++ application development framework.

SoQt - SoQt is a library which provides the glue between Open Inventor library and Qt.


Compilation and Installation:

Qilex is being developed on a Debian/GNU Linux system running the stable distribution. That means,
that you might need a version of GCC, automake (>= 1.5), and autoconf (>= 2.50) to compile it.


Qilex however could be compiled in any other OS that has the libraries. So, it could be compiled in
Windows, Mac, or any other Unix than GNU/Linux.

Do the following:
Download the source and unpack it.
Change into the qilex-x.x.x directory and do
$ ./configure && make
 Do not forget to pass the --with-qt-dir=/path/to/whereisqtinstalled option to the configure-Script,
 I don't know others OS. So any comment will be welcome.
Become root:
$ su
 Give the root password, if the program asks for it.
Do as root:
$ make install
 That's it!
